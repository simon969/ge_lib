Calculate Footing Resistances
-----------------------------

Ground resistances calculated in accordance with the [Eurocode BS EN 1997](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/eurocode-7-geotechnical-design-general-rules?version=standard) and [BS EN 8004](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/code-of-practice-for-foundations-2?version=standard&tab=preview)

JSON Data Validation 
-----------------------------
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

JSON data can be validated at https://jsonlint.com/ this will confirm if your json data is validated
The JSON data for pile resistances and footing resistances have a particular JSON schemas and so can be further validated at https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/
